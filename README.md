# Camera-Lidar calibration using a Neural Network ​
My master's degree project.
The aim of this work is to estimate the rototraslation between the cameras and the LiDAR on a vehicle. 
To obtain this goal the RegNet approach was studied, and a similar NN was developed, modified, trained, and tested on the data used to develop the original model. 
When the model created was close to RegNet it was tested on a dataset obtained with our sensors to measure the performances. ​
